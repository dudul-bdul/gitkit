# GitKit

GitKit turns GitHub into a content management system using the GitHub API and SvelteKit to create, read, update and delete Markdown files and host images.

Features include:

- Great editing experience using the Monaco editor
- Creating, reading, updating and deleting posts
- Save and preview feature
- Uses websockets to preview Markdown so you have control over formatting
- Can be hosted at no cost on services like Vercel to take advantage of serverless functions and server-side rendering
- Bring you own frontend to consume the GitHub API

## Developing
